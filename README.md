FZF-Ranger
==========
Ranger is a terminal file browser built in Python. This is a proof-of-concept app simulating Ranger's basic 
functionality via FZF and a couple scripts I put together. While this does not attempt to reproduce all of Ranger's
features, it's a cool proof of concept and may actually be enough for most use cases that would otherwise use Ranger.
